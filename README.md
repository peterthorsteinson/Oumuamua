A persistent virtual world in a MMRPG (massively multiplayer role-playing game) is the perfect platform for my ideas on bridging between the virtual world and the physical world. Many MMRPGs already feature in-game virtual careers, professions, markets, and economies. I want to explore ways of extending that out into a real-world blockchain to support a crypto-currency-based real-world financial game-theoretic society. A virtual-physical hybrid platform would result. Some new professions will evolve on this hybrid platform, as some enterprising and creative players devise markets and services, so that real human players can provide useful paid-for serves to other humans in the real world. All we need to do is provide the hybrid blockchain platform and programmability, and then let the community do the rest. Example professions would be consulting and training, in areas related to game play strategy as well as real-world education topics, like history and calculus. Imagine merging a Coursera-like MOOC into EVE Online. Another service offering could be a decentralized currency exchange to make an Ethereum game token fungible and liquid with other financial assets. Sort of like EVE Online combined with Ethereum and Binance. Social networking capabilities could be incorporated as well. Sort of like Facebook, but more decentralized and less corrupt, along the lines of Steemit (a blockchain-based blogging and social media website). The result is a Game, a MOOC, a Social Network, and a crypto-token. Ideas from UBI (Universal Basic Income) would implement a virtual reverse taxation, which would seed the economy on an ongoing basis. Many issues to work out to ensure fairness and usability. Do you want to help with this project?
