# Oumuamua

## The Basic Idea

A persistent virtual world in a MMRPG (massively multiplayer role-playing game) is the perfect platform for my ideas on bridging between the virtual world and the physical world. Many MMRPGs already feature in-game virtual careers, professions, markets, and economies. I want to explore ways of extending that out into a real-world blockchain to support a crypto-currency-based real-world financial game-theoretic society. A virtual-physical hybrid platform would result. Some new professions will evolve on this hybrid platform, as some enterprising and creative players devise markets and services, so that real human players can provide useful paid-for serves to other humans in the real world. All we need to do is provide the hybrid blockchain platform and programmability, and then let the community do the rest. Example professions would be consulting and training, in areas related to game play strategy as well as real-world education topics, like history and calculus. Imagine merging a Coursera-like MOOC into EVE Online. Another service offering could be a decentralized currency exchange to make an Ethereum game token fungible and liquid with other financial assets. Sort of like EVE Online combined with Ethereum and Binance. Social networking capabilities could be incorporated as well. Sort of like Facebook, but more decentralized and less corrupt, along the lines of Steemit (a blockchain-based blogging and social media website). The result is a Game, a MOOC, a Social Network, and a crypto-token. Ideas from UBI (Universal Basic Income) would implement a virtual reverse taxation, which would seed the economy on an ongoing basis. Many issues to work out to ensure fairness and usability. Do you want to help with this project?

## Development Plan

I am just starting this project so not much done yet. I started with an ASP.NET Core website with Blazor WebAssembly and SignalR. It will eventually use ION (MS blockchain-based Identity Overlay Network) for decentralized authentication, Unity3D for game engine, and the Nethereum library to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network. These smart contracts will bridge between the persistent game state and the real world in interesting economic ways. It will be an MMRPG style game, like EVE Online. Game play will implement a stochastic Markov process with configurable rules and constraints. Non-player entities (friend and foe) and advisory chat bots will be AI driven using GANS and reinforcement learning algorithms. Players can communicate and collaborate with other players.

Just as the code for this project is open source, the back story is also open source and everyone is welcome to contribute and/or fork code and/or storyline. Initially the story is only a glimmer of a hint of a concept. Hopefully others can supply the creativity to help move it forward. The story behind the game is set in the distant future. The Oumuamua interstellar object plays a role in connecting the present time with the discovery of this distant future.

## Back Story

On 19 October 2017, Oumuamua became the first detected interstellar object passing through our Solar System. In 2025, it is discovered to be of intergalactic origin, and after extensive analysis, it becomes apparent that it was designed and deployed by a distant advanced civilization to provide a wormhole nexus path to many other galaxies in our universe. It was designed to be a mathematical puzzle, so that any life form intelligent enough to solve it would be capable of using it to travel anywhere through space and time, at will, and virtually instantaneously. It is eventually enhanced and extended to allow travel and communication across the multiverse.

Ultimately, this nexus path enables space-time exploration, which first becomes technologically feasible for humanity in 2030, and after another 20 years of intensive robot and AI assisted technological development, in 2050, the first humans and their robot companions begin to travel in space-time via the wormhole nexus path. Many distant worlds are explored and much technology is obtained, such as ultra-powerful quantum computing devices, obtained from many other highly advanced inter-galactic societies. These technologies are communicated back to earth via nexus path quantum entanglement, which rapidly accelerates further technological developments on earth.

### Game Play Level-1: "Exodus Level"

By 2050, humanity has utterly and irreversibly destroyed the ecology and economy on earth. However, the new-found ultra-powerful technologies learned from other cosmic cultures rapidly accelerates new science and computing devices on earth, making it possible to safely escape the fatal and unavoidable earthly global collapse. This is known as the "Exodus".

Each player begins at Level-1 game play as part of this mass exodus from earth around 2055. If the player accumulates sufficient karma crypto token value (gained via battle, theft, deception, trade, etc.) before death (due to battle, starvation, error, disease, etc.), then they progress to Level-2. If they do not achieve sufficient karma in Level-1, they are reincarnated back into Level-1, and retain their previously accumulated karma token value (which could be negative). Note that trickle down karma is provided as an inverted tax (i.e. Guaranteed Minimum Income), that supports a subsistence level life style. Players are incentivized to increase wealth in more proactive ways, which usually involves risk and expenditure to get ahead in the game towards Level-2. Also note that karma is transacted on the Ethereum blockchain in the real world and represents value that can be taken out-of-game at prevailing exchange rates.

### Game Play Level-2: "Faith Level"

After millions of years, an enormous multiverse becomes heavily traveled and populated by the hybrid descendants of the original human and robotic Exodus of 2055 (along with many alien species from other galaxies). Much of the original true earthly Exodus story is lost or corrupted, and eventually becomes a large fragmented religious construct, known as the "Humanity". It is based on assorted holy scriptures (mostly apocryphal) that evolve into what is collectively known as the "Human Testament".

A splinter group of one priestly caste in the Humanity religion makes periodic pilgrimages back to earth (which is totally uninhabitable it this point). Eventually they discover ancient archeological records on earth that refer to the "Church of the SubGenius" (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius), which it develops into the "Human Testament 2.0". This forms the basis of a pervasive and powerful religion of enormous political importance in many regions of the multiverse. Many other minor fragmented groups spin of in other religious directions, based on other ancient scriptural discoveries. One of these, for example, is Discordianism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism). Others are based on Scientology, Mormonism, and the writings of Ayn Rand, Michel Foucault, Noam Chomsky, Karl Marx, and various Cargo Cults, etc.

Upon death in Level-2, if the player does not achieve sufficient karma, they are reincarnated back into Level-2, retaining their acculmulated karma. With sufficient karma, they metamorphose into a god in Level-3.

### Game Play Level-3 "God  Level"

In Level-3, players discover deeper truths about the cosmos and consciousness. Eventually they discover the computational fabric of reality, which they discover can be hacked, to tamper with reality. In this way, Level-3 players are actually the immortal gods who control aspects of Level-1 and Level-2 game play for mortal players. For this reason, Level-3 god players are worshiped by Level-1 and Level-2 mortal players. They are incentivized to voluntarily worship these god players primarily due to the benefit and harm they can impose on mortal players. When a Level-3 god communicates with a Level-1 or Level-2 player, they are experienced as auditory and visual hallucinations. It is very risky for mortal players to not heed these godly communications and act accordingly. This is because a god player can manipulate win-and-loss as well as life-and-death outcomes for lesser mortal players (in capricious ways). In return for their worship, gods may manage and administer game play outcomes for lesser mortal players in a benevolent manner. Note that god players may be kind or cruel, forgiving or vindictive. Itis their arbitrary choice.

However, god players are incentivized to not harm or kill-off mortal players to frequently. This is because the number of living devotees that a god has conscripted determines their own karma accumulation, which represents real world crypto value. If one god attempts to inflict harm on a mortal, another more powerful god (with more karma) can mitigate that harm. High karma gods have more influence and therefore more earning power going forward. In this way there are more powerful and less powerful gods, but the pantheon of gods is competitive and gamified in this way.
