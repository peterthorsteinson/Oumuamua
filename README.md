# Oumuamua

## The Basic Idea

A persistent virtual world in a MMRPG (massively multiplayer role-playing game) is the perfect platform for my ideas on bridging between the virtual world and the physical world. Many MMRPGs already feature in-game virtual careers, professions, markets, and economies. I want to explore ways of extending that out into a real-world blockchain to support a crypto-currency-based real-world financial game-theoretic society. A virtual-physical hybrid platform would result. Some new professions will evolve on this hybrid platform, as some enterprising and creative players devise markets and services, so that real human players can provide useful paid-for serves to other humans in the real world. All we need to do is provide the hybrid blockchain platform and programmability, and then let the community do the rest. Example professions would be consulting and training, in areas related to game play strategy as well as real-world education topics, like history and calculus. Imagine merging a Coursera-like MOOC into EVE Online. Another service offering could be a decentralized currency exchange to make an Ethereum game token fungible and liquid with other financial assets. Sort of like EVE Online combined with Ethereum and Binance. Social networking capabilities could be incorporated as well. Sort of like Facebook, but more decentralized and less corrupt, along the lines of Steemit (a blockchain-based blogging and social media website). The result is a Game, a MOOC, a Social Network, and a crypto-token. Ideas from UBI (Universal Basic Income) would implement a virtual reverse taxation, which would seed the economy on an ongoing basis. Many issues to work out to ensure fairness and usability. Do you want to help with this project?

## Development Plan

I am just starting this project so not much done yet. I started with an ASP.NET Core website with Blazor WebAssembly and SignalR. It will eventually use ION (MS blockchain-based Identity Overlay Network) for decentralized authentication, Unity3D for game engine, and the Nethereum library to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network. These smart contracts will bridge between the persistent game state and the real world in interesting economic ways. It will be an MMRPG style game, like EVE Online. Game play will implement a stochastic Markov process with configurable rules and constraints. Non-player entities (friend and foe) and advisory chat bots will be AI driven using GANS and reinforcement learning algorithms. Players can communicate and collaborate with other players.

Just as the code for this project is open source, the back story is also open source and everyone is welcome to contribute and/or fork code and/or storyline. Initially the story is only a glimmer of a hint of a concept. Hopefully others can supply the creativity to help move it forward. The story behind the game is set in the distant future. The Oumuamua interstellar object plays a role in connecting the present time with the discovery of this distant future.

## Back Story

On 19 October 2017, Oumuamua became the first detected interstellar object passing through our Solar System. In 2025, it is discovered to be of intergalactic origin, and after extensive analysis, it becomes apparent that it was designed and deployed by a distant advanced civilization to provide a wormhole nexus path to many other galaxies in our universe. It was designed to be a puzzle, so that any life intelligent enough to solve it could use it to travel anywhere through space and time at will.

We will need compelling ideas on exactly how these things play out, but ultimately, space-time exploration becomes technologically possible for humanity in 2030, and after another 20 years of robot assisted technological development, the first humans and robot companions begin to travel in space and time via the wormhole nexus path.

Meanwhile, humanity has utterly destroyed the ecology and economy on earth. Ultimately, players play the game as part of a mass exodus from earth around 2055.

At multiple levels of game play, players discover deeper truths about the cosmos, consciousness, and eventually they discover the computational fabric of reality, which can be hacked to modify reality, and eventually new realities can be created at will.
