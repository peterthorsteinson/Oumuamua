Back Story

On 19 October 2017, Oumuamua became the first detected interstellar object passing through our Solar System. In 2025, it is discovered to be of intergalactic origin, and after extensive analysis, it becomes apparent that it was designed and deployed by a distant advanced civilization to provide a wormhole nexus path to many other galaxies in our universe. It was designed to be a puzzle, so that any life intelligent enough to solve it could use it to travel anywhere through space and time at will.

We will need compelling ideas on exactly how these things play out, but ultimately, space-time exploration becomes technologically possible for humanity in 2030, and after another 20 years of robot assisted technological development, the first humans and robot companions begin to travel in space and time via the wormhole nexus path.

Meanwhile, humanity has utterly destroyed the ecology and economy on earth. Ultimately, players play the game as part of a mass exodus from earth around 2055.

At multiple levels of game play, players discover deeper truths about the cosmos, consciousness, and eventually they discover the computational fabric of reality, which can be hacked to modify reality, and eventually new realities can be created at will.
